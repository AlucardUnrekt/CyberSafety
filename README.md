## Level 0. Why I do need security and anonymity?

##### As Edward Snowden said
>*Arguing that you don't care about the right to privacy because you 
>have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don't care 
>about free speech because you have nothing to say.*

Everyone may have a different motivation for setting up anonymity and security for their devices, and you will probably find this chapter not very useful and skip it. It is your right, but I don't recommend doing it, because it will outline some very interesting reasons to think about your network security and anonymity. They will very likely give you extra motivation to follow our advices. 

If I begin this chapter with a question, it would be logical to continue it in the same way, with questions. All of them are linked to the real cases from all over the world. Here they are:

* [Do you watch porn?](https://www.theregister.com/2013/02/18/web_cam_singapore_blackmail/)
* [Are there any websites that are banned in your country?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_websites_blocked_in_the_United_Kingdom)
* [Would you like to be fined for downloading pirated content?](https://www.newser.com/story/306788/woman-gets-6-months-for-using-pirated-copies-of-windows.html)
* [Are you ready to be arrested for posting your photos online?](https://nypost.com/2021/04/20/actress-jailed-in-ghana-for-posing-naked-with-son-on-7th-birthday/)
* [Would you like to have your online activity tracked, analyzed, and based on that, a portrait of you will be created?](https://digit.fyi/uk-mass-surveillance-programmes-ruled-illegal/)
* [Do you like being followed by intelligence agencies?](http://wikileaks.org/)
* [Would you like your online activity data to be studied by advertisers and then sold?](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/do-mhealth-apps-protect-user-privacy)

I think, you now know why do you need security and anonymity. If no, please, send questions and comments to:
