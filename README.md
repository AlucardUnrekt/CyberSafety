## Level 0. Why I do need security and anonymity?

##### As Edward Snowden said
>*Arguing that you don't care about the right to privacy because you 
>have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don't care 
>about free speech because you have nothing to say.*

Everyone may have a different motivation for setting up anonymity and security for their devices, and you will probably find this chapter not very useful and skip it. It is your right, but I don't recommend doing it, because it will outline some very interesting reasons to think about your network security and anonymity. They will very likely give you extra motivation to follow our advices. 

If I begin this chapter with a question, it would be logical to continue it in the same way, with questions. All of them are linked to the real cases from all over the world. Here they are:

* [Do you watch porn?](https://www.theregister.com/2013/02/18/web_cam_singapore_blackmail/)
* [Are there any websites that are banned in your country?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_websites_blocked_in_the_United_Kingdom)
* [Would you like to be fined for downloading pirated content?](https://www.newser.com/story/306788/woman-gets-6-months-for-using-pirated-copies-of-windows.html)
* [Are you ready to be arrested for posting your photos online?](https://nypost.com/2021/04/20/actress-jailed-in-ghana-for-posing-naked-with-son-on-7th-birthday/)
* [Would you like to have your online activity tracked, analyzed, and based on that, a portrait of you will be created?](https://digit.fyi/uk-mass-surveillance-programmes-ruled-illegal/)
* [Do you like being followed by intelligence agencies?](http://wikileaks.org/)
* [Would you like your online activity data to be studied by advertisers and then sold?](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/do-mhealth-apps-protect-user-privacy)

I think, you now know why do you need security and anonymity. If no, please, send questions and comments to:

## Level 1. Strong password

Weak password can easily ruin all your further efforts to protect your confidential data, so this chapter is placed at the beginning and without big words is the basis for all your attempts in staying safe and anonymous.

Using strong passwords is not as simple as it may seem at first sight. And although most users know the fundamental requirements for a strong password, they forget about them in everyday life, preferring a simple and easy-to-remember password to a strong one.

My first suggestion is to divide all passwords by importance: **high importance** and **normal importance**. What are high importance passwords used for? For sites, cryptocontainers or programs that are particularly important to you. I use four high importance passwords.

The first, second and third are passwords for decrypting the hard drive and the information on it, and for decrypting information on encrypted external hard drives (the third password is a "double-bottom" password). The fourth one is the password for accessing the rest of the passwords in the KeePassXC password manager, which we will talk about further.
