## Level 0. Why do I need security and anonymity?

##### As Edward Snowden said
>*Arguing that you don't care about the right to privacy because you 
>have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don't care 
>about free speech because you have nothing to say.*

Everyone may have a different motivation for setting up anonymity and security for their devices, and you will probably find this chapter not very useful and skip it. It is your right, but I don't recommend doing it, because it will outline some very interesting reasons to think about your network security and anonymity. They will very likely give you extra motivation to follow our advices. 

If I begin this chapter with a question, it would be logical to continue it in the same way, with questions. All of them are linked to the real cases from all over the world. Here they are:

* [Do you watch porn?](https://www.theregister.com/2013/02/18/web_cam_singapore_blackmail/)
* [Are there any websites that are banned in your country?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_websites_blocked_in_the_United_Kingdom)
* [Would you like to be fined for downloading pirated content?](https://www.newser.com/story/306788/woman-gets-6-months-for-using-pirated-copies-of-windows.html)
* [Are you ready to be arrested for posting your photos online?](https://nypost.com/2021/04/20/actress-jailed-in-ghana-for-posing-naked-with-son-on-7th-birthday/)
* [Would you like to have your online activity tracked, analyzed, and based on that, a portrait of you will be created?](https://digit.fyi/uk-mass-surveillance-programmes-ruled-illegal/)
* [Do you like being followed by intelligence agencies?](http://wikileaks.org/)
* [Would you like your online activity data to be studied by advertisers and then sold?](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/do-mhealth-apps-protect-user-privacy)

I think, you now know why do you need security and anonymity. If no, please, send questions and comments to:

## Level 1. Strong password

Weak password can easily ruin all your further efforts to protect your confidential data, so this chapter is placed at the beginning and without big words is the basis for all your attempts in staying safe and anonymous.

Using strong passwords is not as simple as it may seem at first sight. And although most users know the fundamental requirements for a strong password, they forget about them in everyday life, preferring a simple and easy-to-remember password to a strong one.

My first suggestion is to divide all passwords by importance: **high importance** and **normal importance**. What are high importance passwords used for? For sites, cryptocontainers or programs that are particularly important to you.

I use several high importance passwords. The unlock my encrypted hard drive and gain access to my password manager (I prefer KeePassXC).

**High priority passwords should only be stored in your head and be as secure as possible. High importance passwords should not be written down anywhere.**

Don't be scared if some terms are not clear to you yet, if you don't encrypt your hard drives and if you don't have a password manager. While going through this guide, you will learn everything step by step and be able to secure your data.

Passwords of normal importance are all other passwords you use, such as passwords to social networks, emails, websites, and messengers. However, the importance and value of every password is determined by you. Your email may contatin the most sensitive information, for example, if you are мaking arrangements to meet your mistress via e-mail while being a popular official.

All information on your computer must be encrypted and you have to enter a password to decrypt it. This is a password of high importance, which you keep in your head. When you have decrypted your hard drive, you can access all your passwords of normal importance, that are stored in the encrypted key file of the password manager. You also use a high priority password to decrypt this file.

Now let's talk about creating passwords that are practically unbreackable. "Practically unbreakable", because in theory any password can be recovered sooner or later, but it can take thousands of years to do it.

Strong password requirements:
* You can not use dates, especially meaningful dates, like your birthday or birthdays of your relatives.
* Your password must not be a word or a phrase. For example, "Vaeltat193" is much stronger than "Valetta193".
* Your password must contain **AT LEAST** 20 symbols. It is not so hard as it seems. *hint: counter-intelligence contatins 20 symbols, electroencephalography contains 21 symbols*
* The password must include upper and lower case letters, more than one number, and special characters. 
* This password should not contain information related to you, address, pet names, date of birth, phone number, favorite team.

Coming up with a strong password that would meet all the requirements above and at the same time be easy to remember is not the easiest task. I suggest you not to put it off and  come up with some strong high importance passwords for yourself right now.
